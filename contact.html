    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    
    <p>Thank you for your interest in our research. If you are considering applying to join our lab, please take the time to review the following details carefully.</p>
    
    <p>Our current research interests span the broad areas of wireless networks, with a particular focus on connected vehicles, cooperative and autonomous driving, edge computing, and applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Further details about our ongoing research can be accessed in the Research section of my website. We recommend reviewing recent publications to gain insight into the nature of our projects.</p>
    
    <p>We are currently in search of well-qualified <strong>MASc and PhD students</strong> to join our group. Applicants should possess a solid academic track record and strong programming skills. Prior research experience is required for PhD applicants and highly beneficial for MASc applicants. Students are expected to work full-time towards their research projects.</p>
    
    <p>Additionally, the following individuals are encouraged to apply:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Self-funded <strong>visiting faculty</strong> from other institutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Postdoctoral fellows</strong> with a solid research background.</li>
        <li><strong>Domestic</strong> graduate applicants and current <strong>MEng students</strong> seeking to transfer to an MSc degree.</li>
        <li><strong>Current</strong> undergraduate students at the University of Windsor who are in their last year with a GPA higher than 80%.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>We also welcome current <strong>undergraduate students</strong> interested in contributing to our lab. You are highly encouraged to apply for the <a href="https://www.uwindsor.ca/outstandingscholars/">Outstanding Scholars</a> Program at the University of Windsor and seek my support for your application. If interested, contact me via email for further details, and include your transcript.</p>

	<h3>Contacting Me</h3>
    
    <p>You may find my email address on the homepage. When reaching out to me via email, please use an informative subject line (e.g., Potential MASc/PhD Student). Additionally, ensure that your email contains <strong>all</strong> of the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A clear indication of whether you require no/partial/full financial support for your studies,</li>
        <li>Your preferred start date for your studies (e.g., Jan., May, or Sept.),</li>
        <li>An up-to-date curriculum vitae along with a list of any publications,</li>
        <li>Copies of <strong>all</strong> university transcripts (in English), and</li>
        <li>A <strong>detailed</strong> description of your programming skills (including simulation tools).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Please submit documents in <strong>PDF</strong> format and avoid using links to personal cloud folders. Lastly, ensure that you provide <strong>all</strong> of the information listed above. Failure to do so may result in your application being discarded without further consideration.</p>
    
    <p>As I receive a substantial volume of emails, please allow for some time for a response. Depending on my workload, this may take a few weeks, so <strong>please be patient</strong>. Repeatedly contacting me to inquire about the status of your application or sending mass emails may lead to your messages being overlooked.</p>
